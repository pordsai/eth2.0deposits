# Hey
We have assembled a team of non-specific guys who are able and willing to demonstrate to the world the capabilities of subgraphs. 
We have chosen several subgraphs of these

protofire/loopring-3_1

1inch-exchange/one-inch-v2

pengiundev/curve-finance

smallonotation/eth2-genesis-analytics

oleksiivinogradov/uniswapv2

jannis/gnosis

balancer-labs/balancer

blocklytics/bancor

synthetixio-team/synthetix-exchanger


Work with them is still ongoing, but prototypes of ready-made dashboards can be viewed at the following links:

https://thegraph.club/curve

https://thegraph.club/1inch

https://thegraph.club/eth2dep


We'll be adding more dashboards soon.

Look for trades and liquidity details for Curve.fi DeFi platform, check seaps on 1inch and monitoring ETH 2.0 deposits - useful dashboards.

We believe that our work will become a shining example of what can be done quickly with the help of subgraphs and will motivate others to develop the project and contribute.
